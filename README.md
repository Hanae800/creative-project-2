## Summary of my Creative Project 2

In Creative Project Number 2, I decided to work with **p5.js** and **Tracery** I combined the two to make both visually and auditory stimulating **unreal tweets **. 

I build off of **exercise number 5**:_The Tracery text grammar aims in a playful way to bring forward the funny/offensive side of Trump’s famous tweet: “North Korean Kim Jong Un stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my button”. We proceeded by adding new adjectives, places, countries, sizes, and characters to the generated sentences._ 

I used the p5.js to embed the tweets in a visual and auditory environment to sort of animate the tweets and draw attention to their funny/cheeky aspect. 


**Here is a sample output from the tracery generated tweets * 

**Kim Jong Un the President has Tiny Plastic button in Korea at Intercourse with Bart Simpson**

**Kim Jong Un the Fool has Tiny Dangerous stick in Egypt at Twatt with Unnamed Barber**

**Trump the Dictator has Heavy Dangerous button in Country at White House with Walter Sobchak**

**Kim Jong Un the Fool has Heavy Serious poop machine in Iraq at Fucking with Regina George**

**Trump the Fool has Heavy Serious wand in Russia at Hell with Bart Simpson**

I think combining the tweets with the colorful/moving background and adding music to it not only brings draws attention to the tweets but also provides an interactive click-based user experience. Since every time the user clicks a new tweet shows up and changed the audio-visual setting. 


**Instructions to run the project ** 

1. Open the p5.js browser editor
2. Upload the sketch.js file available in this repository of this project
3. Access the library here **https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery/blob/master/index.html** or download it from this repository file name **tracery.js**
4. Include the tracery library in the index file (access tab in the dropdown menu to the left) 
5. Save the file
6. Run the sketch
7. Enjoy the results and keep clicking until you grow tired of the funny tweets
8. Also you can just use the full-screen version available at the following link: https://editor.p5js.org/Hanae800/full/kTr_23M0e
9. Enjoy the tracery generated **Unreal Tweets!** 

## Artist Statement

Unreal tweets aim to embed tracery-generated tweets in an audiovisual environment, to draw the attention of the user to the tweets, and also bring out the fun/playful/offensive aspect of the randomly generated tweets. The project builds directly on the p5.js sound library as well. I might be able to further develop the project by introducing random visual elements and maybe more sound effects and visual shapes so every time the user clicks they get different sound effects and a shape, to increase the stimulations.
